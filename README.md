# Getting Started with Create React App with Echarts

## Prepare Project Environment

### `npm install -g create-react-app`

we can install create-react-app globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`. But we can't always use the latest version in that way.
Of course, we recommend using `npx` to install react framework every time.

## Prepare the Project

### `npx create-react-app example`

If we don't install the react framework previously, we need to install it again here.

### `npm install --save echarts`

Here we install the echarts library.

### `npm install --save echarts-for-react`

To work with icons in a react project we need to use the `echart-for-react` package, which depends on the `echarts` package.

## Start the Project

### `npm start`

After preparing the above things, we can start the project now in a browser.
